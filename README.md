# Writer's Block

Writer’s Block is a creative writing mobile-application designed to stimulate the writer’s minds by randomly generating an adjective paired with a noun, and challenging the writer to come up with a story, description, or whatever it is that they wish to write about on the spot within a given amount of time. The timed activity releases the writer’s inhibitions and allows them to write about anything. The key idea here is to make it as easy as possible for the user to write.
